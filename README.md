## Description

This web application is a Custom Logo Maker. This program takes user input through an inquirer, and then generates a custom svg logo in a logo.svg file.

Here is an image of what a sample logo looks like:

## Installation

In order to install the propper programs necessary for this application, run npm i to install the necessary programs. Once you make sure you have the propper versions of jest and inquirer installed, you should be ready to use the program!

## Usage

In order to use this program, run node index within the integrated terminal for the index.js file. Go through the user input to fill out a desirable logo.svg.

Here is a link to a video of me using this program:

## Tests

In order to test this program, I created a shapes.test.js file under the lib directory. This runs through each possible shape to achieve a desired outcome. In order to run the test, simply type npm test into the integrated terminal.
